# Sapnet
Me and two college friends tried to program an application, our idea is to create a social application based on the publication and display of posts for the exchange of information, in which various aspects of university life are present, since there was no such thing and the information had passed through uncomfortable and confusing whatsapp groups.

The app offers the following services:
1. Course ratings: evaluations and comments on the courses of the various faculties.
2. Course bulletin board: general information relating to individual subjects (lectures links, e-mails to professors, links to professors' websites, etc).
3. Sale of books
4. Exchange of notes
5. Carpooling: service that allows non-resident students (but also who live far from the University) to share a means of transport (car or scooter) to reach the University.
6. Private chat


The first part of analysis and design was for a university project then we decided to continue moving on to programming, we used Android Studio and Firebase.
I leave the link of the [figma project](https://www.figma.com/proto/jGUJ68G8nj34majUGd5kiw/home-page?node-id=436%3A11189&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=273%3A2496&starting-point-node-id=436%3A11189) and [the documentation of the entire project also with the analysis and the design](https://github.com/LeonardoBerti07/Sapnet/blob/main/Documentation.pdf).

I mainly dealt with the backend (I also helped in the frontend), to make the database I used firebase to which I connect directly from java thanks to the library.

The code of the main screens are here -> app/src/main/java/leonardoberti/example/sapnet

App programming has stopped as my friends and I are graduating but will resume as soon as possible
